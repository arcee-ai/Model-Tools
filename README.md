# DevNexus

`DevNexus` is a place for experimental projects and code under development and review.

#### Contents

- neonneon.py is the current Parameter Space (PS) and Data Flow Space (DFS) evolutionary merge effort under development.
  - It is self-contained and includes GUI elements to simplify rapid iteration and troubleshooting.
  - This method will not supercede the existing PS evolutionary merge that has already been accomplished;
     - The DFS effort and best practices is the main focus; PS rework is an effort to incorporate both solutions in one.
